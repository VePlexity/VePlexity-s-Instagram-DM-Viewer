PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
===========================================

Overview:
-----------
VePlexity’s Instagram DM Viewer is a personal tool designed to render Instagram message inboxes in a clean, scrollable, offline interface. The viewer allows users to search, highlight, and navigate their Instagram direct message conversations seamlessly using the JSON export provided by Instagram.

How It Works:
---------------
1. Visit Instagram’s Account Center and download your account data in **JSON** format.
2. Extract the zip file and navigate to:
   `/your_instagram_activity/messages/inbox/<username>/`
3. Locate the file named `message_1.json`
4. Load this file into the viewer to visualize your full conversation — offline, without scrolling or login.

Features in Project 1:
-----------------------
✔️ JSON chat rendering with scrollable UI  
✔️ Identity selector to fix sender/receiver alignment  
✔️ Emoji rendering using Twemoji  
✔️ Image & video attachment preview  
✔️ Message highlighting with persistent save  
✔️ Search feature with scroll-to-match  
✔️ Splash screen intro and loader animation  
✔️ Offline-first functionality  
✔️ Clean message layout with compact bubbles  

Limitations in Project 1:
--------------------------
- Reels and some media attachments were unsupported  
- Replies to previous messages were not shown in threaded style  
- Emojis sometimes failed on certain platforms  
- No chat statistics or visual analytics  

Project 2 was launched to address these and take the viewer to the next level.
